## RESPONSE_TEXT

Successfully created the tasks.md file for Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™). The tasks are organized in phases following the spec-driven methodology:

1. Phase 1: Setup tasks for creating the module directory and category.json
2. Phase 2: Foundational tasks for research and preparation
3. Phase 3: User Story 1 tasks for Isaac Sim installation and basic setup (P1 priority)
4. Phase 4: User Story 2 tasks for photorealistic humanoid simulation (P1 priority)
5. Phase 5: User Story 3 tasks for Isaac ROS hardware-accelerated perception (P2 priority)
6. Phase 6: User Story 4 tasks for Nav2 bipedal navigation (P2 priority)
7. Phase 7: Polish and cross-cutting concerns

The tasks follow the required format with proper IDs, story labels where applicable, and file paths. Each chapter will be created as a numbered markdown file following the same pattern as Modules 1 and 2, with proper Docusaurus frontmatter and 800-1500 words of content. The implementation will cover all 8 required topics: introduction to NVIDIA Isaac, Isaac Sim setup, photorealistic simulation, synthetic data generation, Isaac ROS packages, VSLAM perception, Nav2 navigation, and best practices.
