## RESPONSE_TEXT

Successfully created the tasks.md file for Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity). The tasks are organized in phases following the spec-driven methodology:

1. Phase 1: Setup tasks for creating the module directory and category.json
2. Phase 2: Chapter creation tasks for all 8 required markdown files
3. Phase 3: Integration tasks for updating navigation
4. Phase 4: Quality assurance tasks for review and validation

The tasks follow the required format with proper IDs, story labels where applicable, and file paths. Each chapter will be created as a numbered markdown file following the same pattern as Module 1, with proper Docusaurus frontmatter and 800-1500 words of content.
