# Gazebo Unity Digital Twin Planning

## PROMPT_TEXT

```
--continue
```

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Completed the planning phase for Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity). Key deliverables created:

1. Updated plan.md with technical context, constitution check, and project structure
2. Created research.md with technology decisions and alternatives considered
3. Created data-model.md with entities for digital twin simulation
4. Created API contracts in OpenAPI format for simulation control
5. Created quickstart.md with setup and implementation guide
6. Verified compliance with project constitution

The plan outlines implementation of educational content for intermediate AI and robotics students, focusing on digital twins using physics-accurate simulation in Gazebo and high-fidelity visualization in Unity.

## OUTCOME

Successfully completed Phase 0 and Phase 1 planning for the Gazebo & Unity Digital Twin module. All required artifacts generated according to the spec-driven development approach.

## EVALUATION

All planning tasks completed successfully. The implementation plan is ready for the next phase of development.
