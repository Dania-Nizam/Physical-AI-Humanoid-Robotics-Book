# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Course Introduction

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course! This comprehensive educational resource covers the integration of artificial intelligence with robotic systems, with a focus on humanoid robots and physical AI applications.

## Course Structure

This course is organized into multiple modules, with Module 1 covering the foundational concepts of ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), which serves as the "robotic nervous system" for controlling humanoid robots.

## Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

In this module, you'll learn:

1. **Introduction to ROS 2**: Understanding the fundamentals of ROS 2 as the robotic nervous system
2. **Core Concepts**: Nodes, topics, and messages - the foundation of ROS 2 communication
3. **Services and Actions**: Request-response communication and long-running tasks
4. **Parameters and Configuration**: Dynamic configuration management
5. **Launch Files**: Composing complex robotic systems
6. **URDF Fundamentals**: Robot modeling and kinematics
7. **AI Integration**: Bridging Python AI agents with ROS 2
8. **Debugging and Best Practices**: Essential tools and practices

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge (Python recommended)
- Understanding of fundamental robotics concepts
- Familiarity with Linux command line (helpful but not required)

## Getting Started

To begin your journey in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics:

1. Navigate to the first module: [Introduction to ROS 2](./module-1-robotic-nervous-system/introduction-to-ros2.md)

2. Follow the modules in sequence for the best learning experience
3. Practice with the code examples provided in each chapter
4. Experiment with the concepts in your own ROS 2 environment

## Resources

- [ROS 2 Documentation](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/)
- [Docusaurus Documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs)
- Code examples and additional resources are available in the repository

Start with Module 1 to build a strong foundation in ROS 2 concepts, which will be essential for understanding more advanced topics in physical AI and humanoid robotics.
